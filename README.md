# Python Keylogger

This repo has been made to show the keylogger I made from my "Trolling Discord Scammer" video. This should not be used for malicious purposes, and this is purely for educational use.
Doing so will have grave consequences.

This sends the users pressed keys within a few seconds to a discord webhook.

This was made in Python by SillyCoderGirl.

You will need `pynput` and `psutil` to run this code.

please dont be a bum with this code, do everything with ethics.

## Don't be an idiot!!!
To avoid stuff like this exact script running on your PC... **DONT CLICK ON RANDOM LINKS OR DOWNLOAD RANDOM FILES FROM RANDOMS**

It's actually crazy how many of you people fall this stuff. be safe out there, have some basic internet safety.
[This little blippet](https://github.com/piotr-ginal/discord-token-grabber?tab=readme-ov-file#security-measures-and-recommendations) from a token grabber explains this very well if you're still confused.

Have fun and stay safe out there!
Love, Alice <3
